# PC-Automation
Basically this code has been written to initiate your windows PC to work on voice control.
I have used Anaconda Jupyter Notebook for writing whole code.
At first you have to install all the libraries which I have imported in my code
By using pip install Library_name in the terminal of your compiler.
And yes you also have to give less secure app access to your gmail account for accessing gmail using this code and if you dont want to do that then refer to my gmail-access repository in which I have used selenium to access gmail which doesn't need any security access but yes that code is not completed so you have add voice set up in that.
You can also try combining both the repository to see what will happen.
